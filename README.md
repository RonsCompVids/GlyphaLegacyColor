It's Glypha: Legacy - BUT IN COLOR!


Hey, gang!

I've been having a great time playing John Calhoun's reimaging of the classic Mac game Glypha, but thought "Why not colorize it?" So after many hours of transfering sprites from the color version, I have what I feel is a pretty fun mod for Glypha: Legacy.

These files are derived from the freeware version of Glpha III for Macintosh, and the original creator has given permission to reuse them for this mod.

Download, play, and let me know what you!
